## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs  

Lab 1 part 1  
was a favorite lab of mine since it was my first ever introduction to coding c++ on Linux. Together with my partner, we were able solved a pretty easy assignment relatively quick since it was our first ever lab so it was expected to go easy on us, but still very enjoyable.
 
 Lab 3, part 1 
 was one of my favorite lab as I gotten the use of coding by then and it help me better interact with my partner on the assignment. As a result of this it help me learn about the importance of team work in programming. 

 Lab 5 part 1 
 was one of a favorite of mine because I learned a lot from it. It help me learned about calculating the area of triangle, which became a challenge for us to solve. It was pretty hard on us because there was many files to do and our problems solving skills was not the greatest. Despite this, we were able to turn in the assignment and feel proud that we were about to overcome this challenge.
